You can use the Login.pl script supplied with Perlwikipedia to be able to log the bot in without passing its account password in a script. Run the Login.pl script and fill in the specified fields, then modify your bot script to include this code:

{{{
my $status=login($botUserName);
}}}

If you use login() without specifying a password, Perlwikipedia will automatically check to see whether a .perlwikipedia-$botUserName-cookies file exists in the working directory. If it does, the login cookies will automatically be loaded into Perlwikipedia, essentially logging the script in without actually logging in. $status will either be "Success" or "Fail (Cannot read from file)."
