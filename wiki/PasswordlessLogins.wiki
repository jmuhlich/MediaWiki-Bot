==Logging in without a password==
You can use the Login.pl script supplied with `MediaWiki::Bot` to be able to log the bot in without passing its account password in a script. Run the Login.pl script and fill in the specified fields, then modify your bot script to include this code:

{{{
my $status=login($botUserName);
}}}

If you use login() without specifying a password, `MediaWiki::Bot` will automatically check to see whether a `.perlwikipedia-$botUserName-cookies` file exists in the working directory. If it does, the login cookies will automatically be loaded, essentially logging the script in without actually logging in. Note that using cookies saves a network round-trip!
