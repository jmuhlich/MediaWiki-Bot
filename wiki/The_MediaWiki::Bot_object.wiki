#summary Analysis of the internal structure of Perlwikipedia objects

When you initially create a Perlwikipedia object, the object contains some useful settings and internal objects that you can benefit from.

For example, if you perform

{{{
$perlwikipedia_object->{debug}=1;
}}}

then the Perlwikipedia object will print out useful information, such as what page it's retrieving, the status of the login, etc.

The object also contains an internal WWW::Mechanize object you can use, such as

{{{
$perlwikipedia_object->{mech}->get("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page");
}}}

just as if you were using WWW::Mechanize.
