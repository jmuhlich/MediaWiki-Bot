==get_text($pagename,[$revid,$section_number])==

Returns an the wikitext of the specified page. If `$revid` is defined, it will return the text of that revision; if `$section_number` is defined, it will return the text of that section. A blank page will return wikitext of "" (which evaluates to false in Perl, but is defined); a nonexistent page will return undef (which also evaluates to false in Perl, but is obviously undefined). You can distinguish between blank and nonexistent by using `defined()`:

{{{
my $wikitext = $bot->get_text('Page title');
print "Wikitext: $wikitext\n" if defined $wikitext;
}}}
