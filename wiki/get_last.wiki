==get_last($page, $user)==

Returns the revid of the last revision to $page not made by $user. undef is returned if no result was found, as would be the case if the page is deleted.

{{{
my $revid = $bot->get_last("User:Mike.lifeguard/sandbox", "Mike.lifeguard");
print "Reverting to $revid\n" if defined($revid);
$bot->revert('User:Mike.lifeguard', $revid, 'rvv');
