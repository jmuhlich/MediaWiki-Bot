#labels Phase-Implementation
To release a new version of MediaWiki::Bot to the CPAN:

 # Perform a code review of all changes since the last major release
 # Ensure that any new functions or major changes are documented
 # Update ./lib/MediaWiki/Bot.pm with the new version number
 # Update ./Changes with all changes (including, clearly marked, any breaking changes) since the last release, and update with the version number
 # In the repository root, run `dzil release`

You'll need Dist::Zilla installed and configured, as well as a PAUSE account to upload the release.

This is usually the point where you might perform an svn ci, as well as any branching or tagging if necessary.
