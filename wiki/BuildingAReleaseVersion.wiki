#labels Phase-Implementation
To release a new version of MW::B to the CPAN:

 # Perform a code review of all changes since the last major release
 # Ensure that any new functions or major changes are documented
 # Update ./lib/MediaWiki/Bot.pm with the new version number
 # Update ./README with the version number and any changes to dependencies
 # Update ./MANIFEST with any changes
 # Update ./Changes with all changes (including, clearly marked, any breaking changes) since the last release, and update with the version number, release manager, the current SVN revision number, and today's date
 # Update ./Makefile.PL with any changes to dependencies
 # In the repository root, run `perl Makefile.PL`, `make`, and `make test`

This is usually the point where, assuming all tests passed, of course, I perform an svn ci, as well as any branching or tagging if necessary

In the repository root, run `make dist` and `make disttest`

Again, assuming all tests passed, you should have a MediaWiki-Bot-version.tar.gz in the working directory. Upload this to CPAN. You must have a PAUSE account in order to do this, and there is a fancy cpan-upload script on CPAN that makes this step easy.
