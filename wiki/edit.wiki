==edit($data)==

Submits an edit, overwriting whatever was there before. Use `get_text()` to get the text first if you want to modify what's there already. `$data` is a hashref of options:

 * `page` is where to put the text
 * `text` is the text to put
 * `summary` is the edit summary
 * `is_minor` is whether to mark the edit as minor
 * `markasbot` is whether to mark it as a non-bot edit
 * `assert` adds a specific assertion for this edit only
 * `section` edits a single section instead of the whole page (use 'new' to add a new section to the bottom; `summary` will be the heading, if provided)

An MD5 hash is sent to guard against data corruption while in transit.

Here's a typical call to `edit()`:
{{{
my $text = $bot->get_text('My page');
$text .= "\n\n* More text\n";
$bot->edit({
    page    => 'My page',
    text    => $text,
    summary => 'Adding new content',
    section => 'new',
});
}}}
